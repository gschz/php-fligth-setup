# FlightPHP Skeleton Project Instructions

This document provides guidelines and best practices for structuring and developing a project using the FlightPHP framework.

## Instructions for AI Coding Assistants

As you are developing this project, follow these guidelines as close as you can. If you are unsure about something, ask for clarification before proceeding. You should feel 95% confident in the coding decisions that you make, but allow yourself an offramp if you are not sure about something to ask questions.

## Project Structure

Organize your project as follows:

## Development Guidelines

- **Controllers:** Place all route-handling logic in `app/controllers/`. Each controller should handle a specific resource or feature. For large projects, move business logic out of controllers and into the `app/logic/` directory as dedicated classes/services, and call them from your controllers. Use appropriate namespaces for organization. By default, all controllers inject the `Engine $app` variable unless this project has its own dependency injection handler.
- **Namespaces:** Use lowercase namespaces for all classes in the `app/` directory. For example, `app/controllers/HomeController.php` should have the namespace `app\controllers`.
- **Middlewares:** Store reusable middleware in `app/middlewares/`. Register them in your bootstrap or route files.
- **Utils:** Place helper functions and utilities in `app/utils/`.
- **ORM:** This project uses **Eloquent ORM** (via `illuminate/database` Capsule) for all database interactions. Models go in `app/models/` and extend `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`. The `flightphp/active-record` package is NOT used.
- **Migrations:** Use **Phinx** (`robmorgan/phinx`) for database schema migrations and seeders. Migration files go in `database/migrations/`, seeders in `database/seeders/`. Run with `composer db:migrate` / `composer db:seed`.
- **Models:** Data models live in `app/models/` and extend `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`. Use Eloquent's full API (relationships, scopes, etc.).
- **Views:** Store templates in `app/views/` if using a templating engine.
- **Config:** Use the `app/config/` directory for configuration files. `config.php` is tracked in git and reads all values via `getenv()` — it contains no credentials. `$config['database']` holds the connection array passed directly to Eloquent Capsule in `services.php`.
- **Public:** Only expose the `public/` directory to the web server. All requests should go through `public/index.php`.
- **Environment:** All configuration is read via `getenv()` inside `app/config/config.php` (tracked in git, contains no credentials).
  Do NOT hardcode credentials in any tracked file. For local development, create `.envs/.env.local`
  (SQLite, default) or `.envs/.env.pg.local` (PostgreSQL) by copying the corresponding `.envs/*.example`
  template, then load it with `composer dev` / `composer dev:pg` (via `bin/dev.php`).
  In production (Heroku/Railway), set environment variables directly in the platform's config panel.
  The files `.envs/*.local` and `.envs/*.production` are git-ignored; only `.envs/*.example` files
  are committed as reference templates. Do NOT use `vlucas/phpdotenv` or any runtime `.env` loader —
  the app reads env vars already present in the process via `getenv()`.
- **Routes:** Define routes in `app/config/routes.php`. Use the `$router->map()` method to register routes with all request methods or `$router->get()` for `GET $router->post()` for POST etc. and associate them with controller methods. Best practice for defining the controller is [ MyController::class, 'myMethod' ].

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and run `composer install`.
2. Copy `.envs/.env.example` to `.envs/.env.local` and update values (APP_KEY, etc.).
   For PostgreSQL: copy `.envs/.env.pg.example` to `.envs/.env.pg.local`.
3. Run migrations: `composer db:migrate` (and optionally `composer db:seed`).
4. Start the dev server: `composer dev` (SQLite) or `composer dev:pg` (PostgreSQL).
5. The web root is `public/`. All requests go through `public/index.php`.
6. For production deployment (Heroku): set env vars in the platform panel. The `Procfile`
   release phase runs `php bin/migrate-if-production.php` automatically on each deploy.

## CLI Commands

Flight projects can include custom CLI commands to automate tasks such as migrations, seeding, or maintenance. The recommended CLI tool is [flightphp/runway](https://github.com/flightphp/runway), which builds on the [adhocore/cli](https://github.com/adhocore/cli) package (not Symfony Console).

- Place your custom command classes in the `app/commands/` directory.
- Runway will automatically discover and register commands from this directory.
- All CLI commands should be built using the adhocore/cli package (do not use Symfony Console).
- Use CLI commands to manage your application, generate code, or perform routine tasks.

Refer to the Runway documentation for details on creating and using custom commands with adhocore/cli.

## Additional Tips

- Keep controllers focused and small; delegate global or common logic to `app/utils/` when possible. For large projects, move business logic to `app/logic/` and use appropriate namespaces.
- Write tests for class files in the `tests/` directory.
- Use Composer for dependency management.
- Document your code and update the README as your project evolves.
- **Favor simplicity and minimalism:** Keep your codebase simple and avoid unnecessary abstractions or complexity. Only add dependencies when absolutely necessary, as fewer dependencies mean fewer potential issues and security risks.
- **Follow coding standards:** Use PSR1 coding standards and strict comparisons (`===`). Maintain a high level of code quality and consistency throughout your project.
- **Test thoroughly:** Regularly run and maintain tests for your codebase. Ensure your application works as expected.

## Deployment

### Heroku
- Set `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=0`, `APP_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL` in Heroku config vars.
- `DATABASE_URL` (set automatically by the Heroku Postgres add-on) takes precedence over individual `DB_*` vars and enables PostgreSQL with SSL.
- The `Procfile` `release:` phase runs `php bin/migrate-if-production.php` automatically on each deploy, ensuring migrations run against the live database before the new dyno is promoted.
- Do NOT run migrations during the build phase (no DB access there).

### Other platforms (Railway, Render, Fly.io)
- Set the same env vars. `DATABASE_URL` is supported on all major platforms.
- Point the web process to `public/` as document root.

## Security Best Practices (Condensed)

All code must follow secure coding practices. Always treat user input as untrusted. Key requirements:

### Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- Always escape user output in views.
- Use Flight’s view class or a templating engine (e.g., Latte) for auto-escaping.
```php
Flight::view()->set('name', $name);
Flight::view()->render('template', ['name' => $name]);
```

### SQL Injection
- Never concatenate user input in SQL.
- Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
```php
$statement = Flight::db()->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username');
$statement->execute([':username' => $username]);
```

### CORS
- Set CORS headers via utility or middleware before `Flight::start()`.
- Only allow trusted origins.
```php
Flight::before('start', [ (new CorsUtil()), 'set' ]);
```

### Error Handling
- Don’t display sensitive errors in production; log them instead.
- Use `Flight::halt()` for controlled responses.
```php
if (ENVIRONMENT === 'production') {
    ini_set('display_errors', 0);
    ini_set('log_errors', 1);
}
Flight::halt(403, 'Access denied');
```

### Input Sanitization
- Sanitize and validate all user input.
```php
$clean_input = filter_var(Flight::request()->data->input, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
```

### Password Hashing
- Always hash passwords; never store plain text.
```php
$hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
if (password_verify($password, $stored_hash)) { /* Password matches */ }
```

### Rate Limiting
- Use caching or middleware to limit repeated requests.
```php
Flight::before('start', function() {
    $cache = Flight::cache();
    $ip = Flight::request()->ip;
    $key = "rate_limit_{$ip}";
    $attempts = (int) $cache->retrieve($key);
    if ($attempts >= 10) Flight::halt(429, 'Too many requests');
    $cache->set($key, $attempts + 1, 60);
});
```
